Two vegetation types: veg7(grassland) and veg11(forest)
Two variables: flh (flux of latent heat); gpp(gross primary production)

5pa, 10pa, 20pa means the ratio of total grids; all means all grids

When opens file, for example, objflhveg7_all_paras_240.txt
You will see 8361 rows and 240 columns. 
8361 is the total number of veg7 grids, 240 is the total parameter sample number.
The value in the file represents RMSE.

For example, values in the first row means the 240 RMSE corresponding to the 240 parameter samples.
